# Bootstrap Portfolio

#### HTML CSS Bootstrap  


-----------------------------------------


## What is it?

This was the second part of a two-part homework assignment for the second week of the bootcamp I attended. This portion of the assignment was to rebuild the portfolio mini-site we had built for our first assignment using Bootstrap. 

I must admit, this one is wonky.  I should probably go back and touch it up now that I know what I'm doing.  The most obvious problem is that I have absolutely no gutters and the main image on the home page does what it wants.

**For Your Own Curiousity**

The first part of this two-part homework can be found [here](https://github.com/ruthieirl/Responsive-Portfolio). In short, we were to rebuild the portfolio mini-site we had built for assignment one using media queries.
