# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This was my second homework assignment from my bootcamp. The assignment was to rebuild the portfolio mini-site we had built for our first assignment--this time, using Bootstrap.  I must admit, this one is wonky.  I should probably go back into this one and touch it up now that I know what I'm doing.  The most obvious problem is that I have absolutely no gutters.
